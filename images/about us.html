              <p><b>Mission</b>:  &nbsp;&nbsp;Nkuzi advocates for, facilitates and  supports disadvantaged people claiming their rights to sufficient land, secure  tenure, food security, basic services and strategy.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Nkuzi</strong>&nbsp;is a non -profit section 21company (97 2074343/08) providing a range of support services to historically-disadvantaged communities wishing to improve their rights and access to land. Nkuzi started operating early in 1997 and now has 20 full time staff working throughout the Limpopo Province, northern parts of Mpumalanga Province and with farm residents in Gauteng Province.</p>
              <p align="justify">Realisation of this vision is sought through the mission and goals that Nkuzi has set and which are applied across all of the organization 's programmes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Landless People are empowered to drive land reform process which shifts power relations so that the poor, rural and landless access and utilize land equitably and effectively</li>
                <li>Farm residents worked with are informed of their land and related rights and are assisted to exercise those rights.</li>
                <li>An improved level of debate among key stakeholders on pro-poor agrarian strategies and their implementation.</li>
                <li>Quality legal and paralegal support available to enable the poor and landless people to exercise their land other human rights.</li>
                <li>Nkuzi has sufficient resources, effectively managed and implement proper monitoring mechanisms.</li>
              </ul>
              <p align="justify"><strong>Nkuzi</strong>&nbsp;remains focused on four main programme areas that are implemented and outlined here. These are Land Reform Implementation, Farm Dweller, Research and Policy, and Legal Services. The land Reform Implementation programme has small projects such as Community Organizing and Training and Sustainable Livelihoods Promotion and Support. Research and Policy has a sub project Area Land Reform Initiative which is exploring new ways of addressing landlessness in the country. These are all supported by Administration and Finance which forms a fifth area of work.</p>

          <tr>
            <td width="906" height="3169"><p>In  2011, the Zuma government released the New Growth Path to reduce unemployment,  poverty and inequality. It acknowledges that poverty is at its deepest in rural  South Africa.  But government also ascertained that the economic policy will not fundamentally  change. Hence it is doubtful that the NGP may make major dents in the GEAR  policy. The policy framework foresees that 300,000 jobs will be created by 2020  in the smallholder sector and another 145,000 in value-adding activities. </p>
              <p><em>&ldquo;The  framework speaks of forming social partnerships that would translate into the  creation of one million jobs. Government relies on the buy-in of the commercial  agriculture and agribusiness to allow small businesses to have space in the  food market. The likelihood for cooperation with the politically driven program  is not very high. Therefore, sustainability of the jobs created will remain a  challenge. </em></p>
              <p><br>
                <em>The  plans that government has for rural areas are seldom communicated with the  historically marginalized sectors of the rural population. The idea of forming  partnerships with a variety of formations in rural areas is customarily not  preceded by a comprehensive awareness raising process whereby rural people have  an opportunity to understand what is being planned on their behalf. Small scale  farmers, food security groups and women&rsquo;s organizations need to engage  government aggressively about the implications of this document to the local  economy.&rdquo;</em></p>
              <p>The South African government has good policies  on paper, but a problem with the <strong>capability  of state institutions</strong> to implement those policies coherently across the  relevant sectors.  Failures in the implementation of the land reform have led to increasingly  violent rural protest. In addition, quicker and more effective moves towards an  inclusive economy would require restorative <strong>justice</strong> that enables redress of the systematic race and gender  based exclusion of the previous dispensation. </p>
              <p>The reality is far from this.  Section 34 of the 1994 Constitution guarantees that all citizens have the right  to access the courts, but the system still favours the wealthy who can get fast  and effective legal redress. Poor South Africans struggle to get their cases  heard or get legal counsel. Widespread dissatisfaction with performance of the  judiciary has led to people beginning to take justice into their own hands.  Recent attempts of the government to introduce new restrictive legislation like  the Protection of Information Bill (&ldquo;Secrecy Bill&rdquo;), to appoint political  allies to key judiciary and law </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The  government has a budget of almost a billion Rand for a legal aid program for the  poor. 420,365 cases were handled in 2010-11 and over 250,000 people provided  legal advice. The program&rsquo;s CEO considered this woefully short of requirements. The Legal Resources Center  sees the government priorities wrong. Instead of reviewing the Constitutional Court,  it should look at the structural problems at all levels of the justice system. <em>&ldquo;A large part of  our work is focused on dealing with an incompetent public administration  system. If that system fails the poor, you cannot even think of having access  to justice.&rdquo;</em></p>
              <p><br>
                On  the <strong>economic</strong> side, there is great  anxiety as the cost of food and petrol are rising and impacting badly on the  poor. Vast numbers of South Africans have inadequate income to meet basic  nutritional requirements, and many experience periodic hunger. The food chain  has become increasingly &ldquo;corporatized&rdquo; and subject to profit generation by big  companies</p>
              <p><strong>Environmental  conditions</strong> are  also becoming more critical. The mining industry continues to disregard  environmental regulations by pumping toxic waste into rivers which were  providing drinking water for villagers and livestock. Among the culprits of  such practices are politically connected BEE beneficiaries. The effects of  climate change are beginning to be felt in the form of more frequent and severe  weather extremes. South    Africa&rsquo;s high CO2 emissions will affect the emerging farmers to receive assistance  with global relief fund that was launched at COP17 in Durban 2011.  Commercial farming methods and long-distance food transportation are also among  the causes of global warming, i.e. alternative ways of local production and  marketing are required.&nbsp; </p>

                <strong>Agriculture</strong> currently employs around  630.000 people. Over 50.000 jobs have been lost per year since 1970, but the  trend may be turning. Over 30.000 jobs have been created in the second half of  2011. The job creation potential in and around agriculture has been underutilized in  two major ways. (1) Even though the number of smallholder farmers, their  production and wage labor employment has recently been increasing, it is still  far short of its potential and the volumes of the commercial sector. (2) The  value addition potential in agricultural products is far from being realized. </p>
              <h3>Limpopo Province </h3>
              <p>Limpopo  is a largely rural Province and has the fourth largest population in South Africa  with about 5.5 million people (54.6% are women). The share of youth is about  39.4%, and that of black people 97 %. Limpopo  is considered to be a poor province with approximately 87% of its people living  in rural areas and with 23% of households having no access to piped water.  Unemployment figures range from 35, 6% up to 48.8%, the HIV infection is at  21.5 %. The area has a large proportion of over-crowded former Bantustans as well as vast farms owned by white farmers.</p>
              <p><br>
                The  province is divided into five district municipalities, namely: Capricorn,  Mopani, Sekhukhune, Vhembe and Waterberg. Each district municipality is further  demarcated into five local municipalities giving a total of twenty-five. <br>
                Capricorn  District and within it the local municipality of Blouberg are among the worst  but exemplary cases of rural unemployment and chronic household poverty in South Africa.  Blouberg (with a population estimated at 161,322) has the country&rsquo;s lowest  income level. The inhabitants are Bahananwa, Batlokwa, a small portion of  Vha-Venda, as well as Afrikaans and English speaking farmers. </p>
              <p>The area has a  history of resistance to the early 19th century Boer colonial incursion. The  introduction of the Bantustan and trust  systems met with unabated community disapproval. Today Blouberg is one of the  least developed regions of the province. Poverty and labor migration pose  tremendous economic and social challenges to the municipality, especially a very  high proportion of youth and households headed by women and increasingly also  children. The majority of the people are illiterate.</p>
              <h2>South  Africa&rsquo;s problems with land reform              </h2>
              <p>During  most of the 20th century, apartheid had enabled white farm owners to  build successful enterprises by owning the land, receiving extensive subsidies,  operating in a protected market, and exploiting the labour of black workers. In  1994, fewer than 60,000 white farmers owned about 80% of the agricultural land.  Around four million farm workers (including their families) lived on those  farms with little or no tenure or residency rights. The new Constitution of  post-apartheid South Africa  has done away with the basis of that system: <br>
                <em>No  one may be evicted from their home, or have their home demolished, without an  order of court made after considering all the relevant circumstances. No  legislation may permit arbitrary evictions.</em></p>
              <p><br>
                Progressive  legislation followed, but implementation has not always matched the intentions.  The changing agricultural economy reshaped the terrain. Rising prices for  machinery, elimination of subsidies, and droughts made life hard for farm  owners and workers. Farms were given up or turned into game parks. Between 1993  and 2002, the number of commercial farms fell from almost 60,000 to just over 45,000.  Between 1984 and 2004, some 1.7 million people were evicted from farms.</p>
              <p><br>
                &nbsp;The trend has continued since then, but still  about 15% of all employed South Africans work in agriculture. Since 1999,  government policy promoted commercial agriculture over independent farms. A  redistribution program to small peasant farmers was abandoned in favor of one  in support of middle-class black farmers. Major social investment programs were  cut back. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""> </a></p>
              <p><br>
                The  government&rsquo;s <em>White  Paper on South African</em><em> Land Policy</em>of 1997 set  forth three areas for reform: (1) Land restitution for those dispossessed  following the 1913 Natives Land Act; (2) land redistribution, providing  government grants for land purchases on the open market; (3) tenure reform to  address the rights of farm dwellers and farm workers. <br>
                From  the beginning, inadequate budgetary allocations, unrealistic deadlines and a  lack of adequate post-settlement support for land-reform beneficiaries have  hampered both the redistribution and the restitution components of the land  reform program.</p>
              <p> In an attempt to move away from the bureaucratic and fragmented  approach of both programs, the previous Department of Land Affairs adopted an  &lsquo;area-based planning&rsquo; approach in 2007. Area-based planning was to identify  opportunities for land reform in rural areas and incorporate these into  municipal planning and implementation procedures. In practice, planning  remained focused more on land acquisition than on  support for land reform beneficiaries.  </p>
              <p>Nkuzi conducted a pilot program in that context (see ALRI in section 3.1). <br>
                Tenure  reform, theoretically the most important for the farm dwellers, has not done  much better: <br>
                <em>&ldquo;The  tenure security of farm dwellers has not been significantly enhanced since  1994, despite being regulated by the Extension of Security of Tenure Act of  1997 and the Labour Tenants Act of 1996. In fact, farm workers&rsquo; tenure has been  severely compromised and the unintended trend is that the displacement of farm  workers has increased since 1994, such that the proportion of farm workers that  have lost their land rights is higher than the proportions that have gained  strengthened tenure security.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""> </a></em></p>
              <p><br>
                In  2005 the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs convened a National Summit  on land and agrarian reform. The proposals discussed included a moratorium on  all evictions, separation of residency rights from employment status, and  government to acquire land (including expropriation) for sustainable  settlements and farm enterprises. Subsequently there has been little movement  and progress on these resolutions. The ANC 2007 national conference in  Polokwane indicated that land, agriculture and rural development would be given  higher priority than in the past. This emphasis was also evident in the ANC&rsquo;s  2009 election manifesto, and in the new administration&rsquo;s subsequent  announcement of a comprehensive rural development program in June 2009 (DLDLR  2009).</p>
